# MelodyKit

> *All your music, in one place.*

[MelodyKit][MelodyKit] aims to counter the annoyance of having to balance multiple
music streaming platforms at the same time, allowing you to listen
to your favorite songs from all of them in one place. We do not intend
to replace or add another service to the mix, however. This app is
dedicated to allowing users to organize and play songs from multiple
streaming services in one, easy to use application.
